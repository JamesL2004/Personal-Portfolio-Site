                            Hi I'm James. I am currently a student at Lakehead University studying Computer Science with one day hoping to follow my passion by becoming a full-time programmer. 
                            I grew up in Lively, Ontario and went to school at Lockeryby Composite School. In 2022 I graduated from Lockerby with honours and with a SHSM seal in Information Systems and Technology.
                            Currently, I am looking for part-time job oppurtunities in Orillia, Ontario to gain more work experience. I am a passionate, hard-working, and responsible person that any employer can rely on.
